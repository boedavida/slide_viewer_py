# slide_viewer.py. 
Created with Python version 3.9.7, Numpy version 1.21.4 
Python 3 implementation of a class for a digital slide viewer. 

Computes which pixel on a slide to retrieve and display in a pixel in slide 
viewer after a rotation of the slide by a user. 

Sets up a coordinate system for both the viewer and slide. The x- and y-axes 
are what you think they would be. The x-axis is horizontal; the y-axis is 
vertical. Coordinates are expressed as (x,y). Initially , when the slide is 
loaded, the coordinate systems of the slide and the viewer are aligned.

The viewer pixel coordinate and the slide coordinate currently displayed in 
the viewer pixel are encapsulated together in a Display object. As the slide
is rotated with respect to the viewer, the coordinate of the slide displayed 
in the viewer pixel is updated.

Rotation is accomplished by matrix multiplication with a rotation matrix. For 
further information on rotation matrices: https://mathworld.wolfram.com/RotationMatrix.html.

Here the operation is applied to one display pixel, but to get all of the slide 
pixels to display, this same operation is applied to every pixel. This operation
is embarrassingly parallel and so is amenable to GPU impleementation.
